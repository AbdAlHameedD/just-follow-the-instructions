Just Follow The Instructions is a artificial intelligence system solve block world AI problem represented in web using some data structures and planning algorithms.

1.1 The Problem That The System Solve
  The blocks world is a planning domain in artificial intelligence. The algorithm is similar to a set of blocks (Cubes) of various colors sitting on a table in a initial   order then AI should solve the order from initial state order to goal state order.
  
1.2 Objectives
  The objective of the system is to order blocks from state to another state using robot arm in the optimized manner.
  
1.3 System Overview
  Just Follow The Instructions AI is a simulator for robot that represented in web to demonstrate how the robot will work and what the functions he can do, so the robot   has two fingers to hold and drop the block (cube) from/on the table.
  
1.4 Real Life Uses
  There are a lot of situations that robot work in and one of the most example is the commercial port and how work with the containers in the port. So that if the AI       control the manage how he order the containers and move them in the ships and/or trucks the time, money will be saved and decreased error rate.
